### **What is SQL injection?**
```
An SQL injection is a security flaw that allows attackers to interfere with database queries of an application. This vulnerability can enable attackers to view, modify, or delete data they shouldn’t access, including information of other users or any data the application can access. Such actions may result in permanent changes to the application’s functionality or content or even compromision of the server or denial of service.
